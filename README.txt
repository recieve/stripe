The easiest way to add a high conversion Stripe Checkout form to your site and start getting paid.

== Description ==

Add a highly optimized Stripe Checkout form overlay to your site in a few simple steps.

Instead of spending time building your own checkout forms you can use Stripe's, which is continually tested for high conversion.

> "Stripe Checkout is an embeddable payment form for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It works within your site—customers can pay instantly, without being redirected away to complete the transaction."

###Plugin Requirements###

This is a simple standalone Stripe checkout plugin. That's it. No other plugins required.

Note that Stripe suggests that the pages hosting the checkout form be SSL (start with `https://`). [Read more about SSL](https://stripe.com/help/ssl).

###Start Accepting Payments in 3 Easy Steps###

It only takes a couple minutes to add a payment form to your site.

1. Activate the plugin, go to Settings > Simple Stripe Checkout, then enter your Stripe keys.
1. Edit the post or page where you want the payment button and checkout form to appear.
1. Add a simple shortcode.

Viola! Now a payment button that opens your checkout form in an overlay will pop up.

###Add-Ons Available in Stripe Checkout Pro Only###

* **User Entered Amounts** - Let the customer enter what they want to pay.
* **Coupon Codes** - Setup discount codes in your Stripe dashboard for customers to apply to their total.
* **Custom Fields** - Record additional data along with each Stripe payment.

[See Add-On Pricing & Demos](http://wpstripe.net/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=stripe_checkout)

= General Troubleshooting =

Your theme must implement **wp_footer()** in the footer.php file, otherwise JavaScript will not load correctly. You can test if this is the issue by switching to a WordPress stock theme such as twenty-twelve temporarily.

If the overlay doesn't get triggered on click (and your browser is redirected to a stripe.com URL), please make sure that there is not extra code that is hijacking the click event (for example, a Google Analytics onclick event).

A popular known plugin that does this is "Google Analytics for WordPress". Try unchecking one or both of these options: 1) Track outbound clicks & downloads, 2) Check Advanced Settings, then make sure "Track outbound clicks as pageviews" is un-checked.

See the official [Stripe checkout documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout) for further troubleshooting.
