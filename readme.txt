The easiest way to add high conversion Stripe checkout forms to your site and start accepting payments.

== Description ==

Add highly optimized Stripe checkout form overlays to your site in a few simple steps.

Instead of spending time building your own checkout forms you can use Stripe's, which are continually tested for high conversion.

> "Stripe Checkout is an embeddable payment form for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It works within your siteâ€”customers can pay instantly, without being redirected away to complete the transaction."

This is a simple standalone Stripe checkout plugin. That's it. **No other plugins required.**

**SSL Note:** Stripe does require that pages hosting the checkout form be SSL (they should start with `https://`). [Read more about SSL](https://stripe.com/help/ssl)

###Start Accepting Payments in 3 Easy Steps###

It only takes a couple minutes to add a Stripe payment form to your site.

1. Activate the plugin, go to Settings > WP Simple Pay Lite for Stripe, then enter your Stripe API keys.
1. Edit the post or page where you want the payment button and checkout form to appear.
1. Add a simple shortcode. [See shortcode reference](http://wpsimplepay.com/docs/shortcodes/stripe-checkout/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=stripe_checkout)

Viola! Now a payment button that opens your Stripe checkout form in an overlay will pop up.
